# FlashCards
 
## Abstract:
The goal of this project was to write a program that simulates a set of flash cards through the command line. A user can view the flashcard questions, take guesses, and receive a final score at the end of the game. Test-Driven Development (TDD) and red-green-refactoring were used to drive code implementation. A robust test suite was written before any of the implementation code.
